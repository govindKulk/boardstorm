```

Open your browser at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage
- Start the development server and open the app locally.

## Environment Variables

The app can run locally without special configuration, but if you use a separate Socket.IO server or need public URLs, you may configure environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash

## DATABASE & NEXTAUTH SECRETS
DATABASE_URL = "mongodb-database-url"
AUTH_SECRET = ""
AUTH_URL = ""

## GITHUB OAUTH
AUTH_GITHUB_ID = ""
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET = ""

## AI FEATURES
GEMINI_API_KEY = ""
```

## Scripts

Common scripts (your project may have more):

```bash
# Start local development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server (after build)
npm run start

# Lint the codebase
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

The app is live on Vercel:
- https://boardstorm.vercel.app

To deploy your own:
- Push the repository to GitHub.
- Import the project into Vercel and follow the prompts.
- Set any required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
- Trigger a deployment; Vercel handles build and hosting.

## Roadmap
- Enhanced drawing tools (shapes, text, colors)
- Presence indicators and multi-cursor support
- Board persistence and history
- Export/import boards
- Performance optimizations and mobile refinements

Contributions and ideas are welcome!
